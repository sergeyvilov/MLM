        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job get_tss_bed since they might be corrupted:
/s/project/mll/sergey/effect_prediction/promoter_mutations/genes_GRCh37/genes_GRCh38.bed6
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
