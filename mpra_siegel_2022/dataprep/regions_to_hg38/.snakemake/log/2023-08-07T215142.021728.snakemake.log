Removing output files of failed job liftover since they might be corrupted:
/s/project/mll/sergey/effect_prediction/MLM/siegel_2022/regions_hg38/regions_GRCh38.liftover.bed, /s/project/mll/sergey/effect_prediction/MLM/siegel_2022/regions_hg38/regions_GRCh38.umap
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
