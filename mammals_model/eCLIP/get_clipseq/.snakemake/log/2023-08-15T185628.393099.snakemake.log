LockException:
Error: Directory cannot be locked. Please make sure that no other Snakemake process is trying to create the same files in the following directory:
/data/nasif12/home_if12/l_vilov/workspace/species-aware-DNA-LM/mammals_model/eCLIP/get_clipseq
If you are sure that no other instances of snakemake are running on this directory, the remaining lock was likely caused by a kill signal or a power loss. It can be removed with the --unlock argument.
