Removing temporary output /s/project/mll/sergey/effect_prediction/MLM/griesemer/liftover/transcripts_canonocal_GRCh38.umap.
Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule liftover_oligo in file /data/nasif12/home_if12/l_vilov/workspace/species-aware-DNA-LM/dataprep/test_data/griesemer/liftover/Snakefile.py, line 58:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/s/project/mll/sergey/effect_prediction/MLM/griesemer/liftover/transcripts_canonocal_GRCh38.umap
Removing output files of failed job liftover_oligo since they might be corrupted:

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
